🎓 CS | AI Concentration @ North Carolina State University '25 🎓
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Tempest](https://github.com/hpatel-27/Tempest-Fitness)⚡, a full-stack fitness application to help users track their weight and log their workouts to monitor changes and progression. I'm also working on my [portfolio website](https://hpatel-27.github.io/) to show others who I am.
- 🌱 As my degree has a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, I am actively expanding my knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I also have a strong interest in developing full-stack web applications, as it provides the satisfaction of seeing my back-end solutions come to life through interactive front-end interfaces.
