## Hello World, I'm Harsh PatelðŸ‘‹
CS | AI Concentration @ North Carolina State University '25

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Tempest](https://github.com/hpatel-27/Tempest-Fitness), a full-stack fitness application to help users track their weight and log their workouts to monitor changes and progression. I'm also working on my [portfolio website](https://hpatel-27.github.io/) to show others who I am.
- ðŸŒ± As my degree has a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, I am actively expanding my knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I also have a strong interest in developing full-stack web applications, as it provides the satisfaction of seeing my back-end solutions come to life through interactive front-end interfaces.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at harshpxv@gmail.com!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a huge Toronto Raptors fan. Feel free to shoot me a message to talk about them anytime!
